## City Weather App

This project is a simple flutter app that displays an input city's current weather. It presents the following features:

- Uses the [Weather package](https://pub.dev/packages/weather) to fetch a city weather and output the search result.
- Uses the [Weather Icon package](https://pub.dev/packages/weather_icons) to display the icon accordinly to the state of the fetched weather (sunny, cloudy etc.)
- Uses the [Bloc library](https://bloclibrary.dev) and presents a cubit for the app state managment.
- Contains unit tests as well as widget and bloc tests.
